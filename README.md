in this project i followed the mock-up guide to put navigations in the top of the web page. there are about me, contact, my work and also resume. the link with resume i uploaded my resume on google doc. the works part are just replaced with random stock picsture online because I havent had any projects yet. and the contact me part i used linkedin instead of spotify. i used color pick extension to identify the color used in mock up in order to have the same color for my web page. the big difference i made is the hero picture. instead of looking for the same hero pic from the mock up, i used something that i think looks cuter and matched more with my personality. formating and styling through css is defintetly very hard and random.
