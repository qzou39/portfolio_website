        <p>I am a senior at Georgia Institute of Technology. I double-majored in biomedical
            engineering and psychology. I am very much certain that BME is what I want to pursue. It probably
            has something to do with the fact that my whole family are engineers. The first real toy they bought
            me was a fruit-power battery experiment kit for kids, which came with some tiny light bulbs and
            a lab manual for experiments. I wasn’t satisfied with merely seeing those color changes of
            bioelectric light bulbs - I wanted to know the biochemical and physiological functions, anatomical
            and histological structures, epidemiology, and pharmacology, and that started my interest in
            biomedical science. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Psychology, on the other hand, has made me think deeper about what is
            reliable and what isn’t. My reflection on reliability has made me appreciate engineering, for its
            precision and pragmaticism. My experience in psychology taught me that I have made the right
            choice in pursuing biomedical engineering.</p>
